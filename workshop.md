## Workshopping research questions

I. Context and question
  > If you came to this workshop with a project in mind, share with your team the underlying research question of the project, or one of the research questions associated with some part of your project (depending on its scope). With no concern about whether it's easy or difficult, feasible or not, discuss how you would like computational to fit into this question.

  - Participants share results

II. How textual quantification can help (exploratory or confirmatory)

  > I'll share some examples of computational text analysis interventions. Participants are encouraged to share their own or ask questions. Knowledge of particular methods is not assumed or required.

III. Complication and qualification

  > What factors might complicate or limit the role computational text analysis might play in addressing your research question. These might be logistical (how do you identify verbs?) or conceptual (how do you measure agency?) or anything in between.

  - Participants share results

IV. Study or inquiry design

  > I'll share some examples of study design for computational text analysis. Participants are encouraged to ask questions, raise complications, etc.

V. Assessment of needs

  > I'll share some examples of how certain lines of inquiry create the need for particular skill sets, types of data, and curation plans. Participants are encouraged to ask questions, raise complications, etc.

VI. Making a Plan

  > This will be more of a discussion but will feature ideas like exploring tools, finding resources, forming partnerships, and setting goals.
